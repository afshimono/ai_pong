# ai_pong
Evaluation of different artificial intelligence approaches to learn how to play the classic video-game Pong.

In order to run the tests, you need 3 main files: one is for the game (Pong), one for the artificial intelligence algorithm you are using
(in our case, q-learning) and the last one for the way we modeled the game for this algorithm (like the relative position, for an example).
